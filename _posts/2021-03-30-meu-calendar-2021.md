Without a doubt, this MEU season is still heavily impacted by the ongoing pandemic and it is likely that many of our conferences, which involve dozens of participants and international travel, will not be able to take place as planned, or only under very tight restrictions. Nevertheless, BETA Europe, its branches and partners are working hard to continue offering high-quality educational events allowing you to discover the European decision making process and meet awesome likeminded Europeans.

As a consequence of the situation, any events planned for this year will take place online and are therefore accessible to anyone without regard to your geographical location, financial situation, ability to travel or putting your health at risk - all you will need is a computer, a stable internet connection and you're ready to join us!

We kindly invite you to have a look at the [MEU calendar ](https://www.beta-europe.org/calendar/)on the website as well as this[ overview sheet ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnXx3Ax6BCtI93Rmud-iGB8gPdAW0v-5mKMh7eT2Opg/edit?usp=sharing)which will be continuously updated as more and more conferences announce precise dates. As usual, please visit the indicated website and/or social media channels to find out more information about the specific conference and how to apply. 

We are looking forward to welcoming you at one of our many (online)MEU's this year!
