Panel discussion has gathered more than 100 young Europeans and students based in Krakow. They had the chance to hear and discuss with experts relevant issues in the contemporary EU politics, amongst others Europe’s future prospects, the engagement of the youth in European politics and of course about the crucial importance of the upcoming European Elections taking place between the 23rd-26th May 2019.
