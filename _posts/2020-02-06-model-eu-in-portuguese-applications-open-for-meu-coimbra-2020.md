BETA Portugal is organising the third edition of its national language MEU in Portuguese. After Lisbon and Porto, the beautiful city of Coimbra, home of one of Europe's oldest universities, now hosts the most realistic simulation of EU Politics!



From 19 to 23 February, 100 young participants from all over the Portuguese-speaking world shall take on the roles of MEPs, Ministers of the Council of the EU, Journalists, Lobbyists and - a first in Portugal - Interpreters! 



Two legislative proposals shall be discussed: the Regulation on screening of  Foreign Investment and the Withdrawal Agreement of the UK from the EU. Ms Andreea Serban (Director General MEU Iasi) and Mr Wassim Essebane (Director General Brussels MEU) shall act as European Commissioners for the conference.



Although Portuguese shall be the official working language, international applications are welcomed, and are open until 14 February.
