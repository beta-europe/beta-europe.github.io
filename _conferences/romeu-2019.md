The Model European Union of Rome is a dynamic and exciting project, addressed to all those students seeking to have a first approach to the European political scenario.

At a time when post-war geopolitical models are changing and mutating, young people are called to play an active role in society, making their voices heard. This project, in participation with BETA Italia, aims to lay down the basis of political dialogue and exchange of ideas in an international context. Participants will act as members of the European Parliament and Ministers of the Council of the European Union, receiving different objectives and negotiating strategies.

The ultimate goal is to obtain the approval of two EU directives or regulations, favoring the assigned position and taking into account the public interest. It is a collaborative competition, where students have the opportunity to deepen and discuss issues of international politics.
