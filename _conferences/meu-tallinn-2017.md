The umbrella organisation Euroopa Maja is an Estonian-based NGO facilitating young people to practice debating while getting informed about the legislative process and the functioning of the EU.

MEU Tallinn is a Model European Union simulation with a unique format which makes it possible for participants to play both roles of Ministers and MEPs during the same simulation. For MEU Tallinn 2017, the simulation will also include journalists for the first time in MEU Tallinnâ€™s history!
