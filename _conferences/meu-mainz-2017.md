AEGEE Mainz-Wiesbaden e.V. is part of the AEGEE network: We're a interdisciplinary student initiative with the aim to foster democratic, diverse and borderless Europe. AEGEE offers a platform to organize whatever type of event you want. Therefore there is a vast variety of different things to do throughout the year, such as student conferences, Summer Universities and thematic workshops. You can visit all type of events in about 170 different places all over Europe.
In Mainz, we're mainly responsible for the Model European Union, but we also try to include Erasmus students with various different events and give them a good start in our city. 
The motto is always: Some call it Europe, we call it home! We want to make friends all over Europe and get to know our beautiful continent.

Model European Union Mainz is a simulation of the European decision-making process, hosted for the 8th time in the city of Mainz, in cooperation of AEGEE Mainz-Wiesbaden and BETA. With around 100 interesting participants coming from all over the world and international cooperations with other universities, we offer an interesting and diverse simulation, located in our beautiful city directly located at the Rhine.
Our Simulation takes place at the University campus in the city centre, our guest will be hosted in a hostel near our simulation venue.
