Model European Union Zagreb is an international educational conference which gathers the most enthusiastic young people from around the world. It is designed as a combination of the simulation of the decision-making procedure of the EU institutions (the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union), workshops and structural dialogues with decision makers on the current issues.

MEUZ 2017 is the fifth edition of the conference which is annually organized by a group of highly motivated students, whose aim is to spread the knowledge about the EU institutions among their peers and prepare them for the EU of tomorrow. In previous editions, activities of the conference had a direct impact on more than 300 students and young professionals on their professional and personal development. MEUZ has received the support from many European and Croatian institutions and the relevance of the project was recognized by the Agency for Mobility and the EU Programs so this will be the third year in a row that the project is co-funded by the Erasmus+ program.
