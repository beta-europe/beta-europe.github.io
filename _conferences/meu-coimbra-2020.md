BETA Portugal is organising the third edition of its national language MEU in Portuguese. After Lisbon and Porto, the beautiful city of Coimbra, home of one of Europeâ€™s oldest universities, now hosts the most realistic simulation of EU Politics!

From 19 to 23 February, 100 young participants from all over the Portuguese-speaking world shall take on the roles of MEPs, Ministers of the Council of the EU, Journalists, Lobbyists and - a first in Portugal - Interpreters!

Two legislative proposals shall be discussed: the Regulation on screening of Foreign Investment and the Withdrawal Agreement of the UK from the EU. Although Portuguese shall be the official working language, international applications are welcomed until the 14th February.

The event counts on the High Patronage of the President of the Portuguese Republic, the European Parliament Information Office in Portugal, the European Commission Representation in Portugal and the Rector of the University of Coimbra,
