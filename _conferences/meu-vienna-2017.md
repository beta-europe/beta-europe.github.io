Model European Union is a simulation of the European law making process.

The first simulation of the European Union took place in 2007 in Strasbourg and became a huge success with the support of the European Parliament and the European Commission. Today MEUs can be found in many different countries of the European Union like Belgium, Spain, Germany, Croatia and many more. The idea is to connect young people from all over Europe and to learn about the inner functioning of the EU and its legislative procedure.

MEU Vienna is the first MEU simulation in Austria and had its premier in February 2014. In February 2016 we have had the third edition of MEU Vienna and the next conference is going to take place on 23rd-26th of February 2017. In cooperation with the BETA, organisers of the original MEU in Strasbourg, we aim to provide a perfect experience for all participants.
