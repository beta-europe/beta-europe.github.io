Model European Union Paris is a high-quality simulation of European politics organised in Paris by BETA France. It aims at simulating the European decision-making process by modelling the Unionâ€™s two co-legislators, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, also featuring a journalist team and lobbyists from various horizons.
