Model European Union Tallinn is a simulation of EU decision-making organised annually by the Estonian Europe House Association and an experienced international team. More than a hundred young people from dozens of different countries will gather in Estonia’s romantic, medieval capital to discuss the issues currently at hand in the EU. All of the programme takes place in the old town – within walking distance of the accommodation. The session has been an annual occurrence ever since 2011 and is, currently, the only MEU simulation in northern Europe.

MEU Tallinn 2016 will be taking place from the August 21 until August 27 this year. Around 100 people from all over the world are expected to join us in Tallinn in order to deliberate upon three topics: EU & Ukraine relations, the EU’s response to the refugee crisis and towards a common energy strategy for Europe.
