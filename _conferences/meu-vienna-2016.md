Model European Union Vienna 2016 (MEU Vienna 2016) is a simulation on how the main bodies of the European Union (European Commission, European Parliament and the Council of the European Union) function and was held from 25.-28. February 2016. MEU mainly aims to provide people between the ages of 18 â€“ 30 years with more insight and knowledge on how decisions are made within the European Union and especially the ordinary legislative procedure. With the simulation we aim to connect young people from all over Europe and to show the interaction and work of the European Parliament and Council.
