BETA Portugal was created in November 2017. Inspired by the fire that runs in this truly European family, a group of friends from the entire country got together and decided it was the perfect time to make BETA Portugal happen.

BETA Portugal subscribes to the mission and values of fellow BETAs and has the goal of hosting two MEUs each year: one international and other in portuguese, at the national level, every year in a different part of the country. This project wants to include all, specially those who wouldn't , in regular conditions, be able to go abroad to experience and live the European spirit. You can find more about the team members, projects and news on the website portugal.beta-europe.org/
