BETA Ukraine is an independent organization the core goal of which is to foster a closer interaction between European countries for young generation. We aim to create an environment where students would be able to learn deeper how does the EU work, gain practical skills by means of simulations and get intercultural experience by interacting with like-minded students from all over Europe. We believe that by learning and trying, the exchange of ideas and experiences will motivate and encourage students and young people to strive for the better.
