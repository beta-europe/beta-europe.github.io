BETA Bulgaria was founded in September 2016, by a small team of volunteers in order to recreate and organise better MEU Sofia and expand the format in Bulgaria. So far they have organised a very successful Model European Union Sofia 2017 and have launched another project - #HighSchoolEuropeanCouncil which is a one-day simulation aimed at high school students as an introduction in the world of legislative simulations and European studies.

Currently they are organising Model European Union Sofia 2018, which will take place in the midst of the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and #HighSchoolEuropeanCouncil Varna 2018, due to take place in March.
