LAU MEU is a prestigious student simulation leadership program with the mission of giving the Lebanese High School students and the community at large the opportunity to deeply explore the European Union through various dimensions. This program enables students to understand the strategic geographic potential of the EU Member States; as well as, their thriving economic and human capabilities. It also focuses on promoting the idea of cooperation and teamwork that is reflected through the interdependence among the EU Member States at the commercial, cultural, and social levels.
