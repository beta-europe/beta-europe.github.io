BETA Greece is a non-profit national youth association founded in June 2018. Its primary goal is to bring young people closer together, while creating a challenging learning environment about the European Union and its institutions. \
Its flagship project will be Model European Union Athens, scheduled to premier in 2019-. The project aims to promote knowledge of the decision-making process, representing the way new EU legislation comes to force while fostering mutual understanding and cooperation through debate and dialogue.
